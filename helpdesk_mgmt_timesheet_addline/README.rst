Adds a more accesible button for timesheet creation within ticket form

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

With this new button timesheets are immediately created after editing, even if
general ticket edition is cancelled. In fact, if the timesheets occurs during a
new ticket edition, the ticket is actually created, at this time. The desired
behavior should be the standard one (the whole ticket should be updated in a
single operation, or not updated at all).
